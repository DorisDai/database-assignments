# COMP3311 23T1 Final Exam
# Q9: Transactions

A.

(i) conflict serializable? (show working)
for x: T1 -> T2
for Y: no conflict
so it is conflict serializable

(ii) view serializable? (show working)
yes
T1 -> T2
T1:  R(X) R(Y) W(Y)
T2:                 R(X) W(X)   

B.

(i) conflict serializable? (show working)
for x : T1 -> T2
for Y : T2 -> T1
cycle formed, so it is not conflict serializable

(ii) view serializable? (show working)
yes 
T1 -> T2
serial schedule 
T1:  R(X)  W(Y)
T2:              R(Y)  W(X)

C.

(i) conflict serializable? (show working)
for x : T1 -> T2 -> T3
for y : T2 -> T1
cycle between T1 and T2, so it is not conflict serializable


(ii) view serializable? (show working)
T3 last write on x, T2 -> T1 -> T3
T1:             W(Y)  W(X)
T2:  R(Y)  W(X)
T3:                        W(X)
